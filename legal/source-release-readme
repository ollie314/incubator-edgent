Building Edgent from a Source Distribution

Apache Edgent is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF),
sponsored by the Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted
projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications,
and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection
of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project
has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Pre-requisites:
- Java 8 is required to build an Edgent binary distribution

Build an Edgent binary distribution:
$ cd edgent           # the root of your Edgent source tree
$ ./gradlew release   # .\gradlew.bat on Windows

The build reports the location of the binary distribution bundle that can then
be unpacked and used in building applications.
